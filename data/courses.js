      "The Level 7 Artificial Intelligence Data Specialist apprenticeship programme is designed to enable learners to develop a deep technical knowledge that allows the discovery and creation of new data-driven AI solutions.  These solutions should help to automate and optimise business processes and to support, augment and enhance human decision-making \n\n AI Data Specialists carry out applied research in order to create innovative data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to business problems within the constraints of a specific business context. They work with datasets that are too large, too complex, too varied or too fast, which render traditional approaches and techniques unsuitable or unfeasible. The programme consists of 6 key modules completed across 15 months and culminates with an EPA with the British Computing Society (BCS) to confirm the achievement of the apprenticeship standard.",
